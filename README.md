# Sublime Pebble

Sublime Pebble aims to be the ultimate package to help developers write watch faces and applications for their [Pebble](https://getpebble.com/) devices.

This is a work in progress, so there isn't much going on yet, but it will be improved upon!

# Contributing

Feel free to contribute! There is a lot left to do, commands to add, things to make better. The only thing I ask is that you stick to the styles and standards already used.

# What is this?

## Compatibility
Sublime Pebble is currently compatible with `V2.7` of the SDK.

## Installation

You can install via Package Control, just search "Pebble".

## Commands

Sublime Pebble uses the command palette to respond to these commands:

1. `build`
2. `clean`
3. `install`
4. `screenshot`
5. `ping`
6. `list`

You can also supply a custom command (without parameters at the moment).

## Completions

Currently there are only completions for the Foundation set of modules and a subset of the constant values.
